# the DEFAULT_ENTRY option determines if and how the default entry in loader.conf should be managed
#   "latest"    The most recent CachyOS kernel will be used(the one with the highest version number)
#   "oldest"    The oldest CachyOS kernel will be used(the one with the lowest version number)
#   "manual"    Don't modify the default setting

# ENTRY_ROOT is a template that describes the beginning of the name for system-boot entries
# The ENTRY_ROOT will be followed by the kernel version number
# For example, if ENTRY_ROOT="CachyOS" your entry will be named "CachyOS.conf"

# ENTRY_TITLE is a template that describes the beginning of the title of (i.e. the text displayed in the loader screen for) systemd-boot entries

# if PRESERVE_FOREIGN is set to "yes", do not delete entries starting with $ENTRY_ROOT

# setting NO_AUTOUPDATE to "yes" will stop the updates to systemd-boot when systemd is updated - not recommended unless you are seperately updating systemd-boot
